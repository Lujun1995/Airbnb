# Using data to understand the difference of AirBnB rental markets between Seattle and Boston
## Overview
In this project, I aimed to compare the AirBnB rental markets of Seattle and Boston by using the AirBnB data from the kaggle. Mainly, I plotted the distribution of the price of two cities to see if there is any difference. In additon, I also built a model to predict the price by using the variables of interest.
